# MQTT Websocket Dashboard 

I modified this dashboard and adding some code . this is not my own dashboard .credit the orginal uploader.
I searched for a opportunity to receive `mqtt` message from my `ESP8266 Module` and display it live in a Browser. I found a tutorial from [Robert Hekkers](http://blog.hekkers.net/2012/10/13/realtime-data-with-mqtt-node-js-mqtt-js-and-socket-io/). But the example didn't work for me.

After some hours spent on studying `node.js`, `Javascript` and `Socket.io` - i ended up with this nice looking Dashboard.

Basically it's the same concept of code with some enhancements.

## How to Install:

1. Install `node.js` (in my case, i used the newest Package-Installer for Mac from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.1.0/))
	
		brew install nodejs


2. Clone the Repo

		git clone https://github.com/eLement87/mqtt-websocket-dashboard.git

3. Download the Dependencies

		npm install mqtt
		npm install socket.io
		
4. Start the Server

		node app.js
		
5. Open your Browser

		http://localhost:8888


## How

I used ESP32 on my ESP-Module that publish's the Data to my Raspberry and Mosquitto.


## To Do...

 - ...better Documentation
 - find out how to build the div's dynamicly based on the topic names/data (static divs)
 - how to build a config menu to subscribe topics in a webinterface and save that to a database
 - better comprehension in Javascript etc.
 - and of course better englisch :D

 If somebody have the knowledge or improvements - feel free to send a pull request to tell me how ;)
